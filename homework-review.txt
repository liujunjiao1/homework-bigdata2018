 1. Each one as reviewer will get 5 homeworks to review.
 2. The reviewers should read the source code and grade them from the following aspects
 	1) correctness, correctness of functionality the code provides
 	2) test, proper doctest, unitest, testsuite in __main__, help message?
 	3) documentation, proper docstr, proper comment, copyright, author, version information?
 	4) exception, proper exeption handling, type checking 
 	5) pep8, how the code follows PEP8?
 3. Grading the homework with the specific criterion, you would give A,B,C and D respectively.
